##For this project we:
+ used a Bayesian approach to infere the FWHM of each gamma peak for all available gamma sources.
+ performed a calibration of the detector by associating the centroid of each peak to the nominal value of the detected gamma full energy peak.
+ used MCMC to study the behaviour of the energy resolution as a function of the photon energy.
